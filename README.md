#Project Description
  Our project is to predict whether the gestation period of maternal health is risky or not. This is predicted by machine learning.
  The maternal health data has been collected and different machine learning algorithm are used for the prediction of the maternal health.
  The Trained Machine learning model takes the parameters regarding the maternal women as input and then predicts the risk level of maternal health.
